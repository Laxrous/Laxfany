Used to be An SNSD Theme for BetterDiscord that allows you to change the color, the images for the main background, user popout, profile header, and settings, and the emoji sizes. But discord added many customization features so there's no point in adding background images in some areas. Now, just a generic transparent theme that I use with BetterDiscord's Enable Transparency and my hundreds of wallpapers.

#### Special Thanks
- This theme is an edited version of Zerthox's [ClearVision](https://github.com/Zerthox/ClearVision/). I got impatient waiting for his updates.
- BeardDesign's [SmarterEmbeds](https://github.com/BeardDesign1/SmarterEmbeds) is great for kpop servers since all we do is send pictures. Now only if everyone could stop sending one link at a time...
